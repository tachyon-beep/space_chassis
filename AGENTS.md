## Filigree Issue Tracker

`filigree` tracks this project's work. Use it to find, claim, update and close
issues: `filigree session-context` at session start, then
`filigree start-next-work --assignee <name>`.

Full reference: the **filigree-workflow** skill (patterns, priorities,
observations, error codes), `filigree --help`, and the `mcp__filigree__*` tool
schemas. Prefer the MCP tools when available; fall back to the CLI.

Two rules `--help` will not tell you:

1. Claim atomically: `work_start` / `work_start_next` (MCP) or `start-work` /
   `start-next-work` (CLI). Never chain a claim with a separate status update;
   that two-step form races other agents.
2. On `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` the installed filigree is older than the project
   database. Surface it to the user; do not retry.
